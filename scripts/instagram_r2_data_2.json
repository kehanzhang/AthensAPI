While I‚Äôve always been proud to call her my daughter, that pride reached new heights when I watched her cross that stage in June. It‚Äôs a remarkable thing to see your child embark on a similar path of building something new and to be able to offer some insight. But ultimately, it‚Äôs Phoebe‚Äôs dedication, amazing ability to bring people together, and willingness to take risks that lead her to make a lasting impact in everything she does.\n\nShe‚Äôs not only an incredible student‚Äîshe‚Äôs an incredible daughter, and an even better person. @phoebegates, as you move into the next chapter of your life, I have no doubt you‚Äôll continue to soar.",

MK1 will be capable of delivering three metric tons to any location on the Moon‚Äôs surface. That capacity makes it ideal for a variety of logistics, infrastructure, and science payloads.

As we celebrate, I‚Äôm thinking about all those who dedicate their lives to protecting our freedom and independence.\n\nRecently in DC, I had the privilege of meeting with leaders of the Department of Air Force (DAF) Women‚Äôs Officers Forum (WOF) ‚Äî a @leaninorg Network for Air Force active duty, reserve, and guard women officers. With more than 12,000 members, the Lean In WOF is a space to connect, share advice, and drive lasting change. They proudly call each other ‚Äúsisters in arms.‚Äù It was so inspiring to hear how they are building a more equitable Air Force through initiatives like improving family leave, conducting policy feedback surveys, expanding access to reproductive health care, and more.\n\nOne story that stood out came from Lieutenant Colonel Elizabeth Blakeman (@eblakeman). She explained how military mission gear was originally designed to fit men, which left women‚Äôs vital organs exposed. This not only made women less safe, but it was also more challenging for them to accomplish their missions ‚Äî whether flying an aircraft or fighting on the ground. The Lean In WOF set out to change this. Over the last five years, they worked in partnership with other groups to source and update uniform requirements. They secured advocates and funding for research and development for new gear. Now, women have access to new equipment that allows them to serve at their fullest potential.\n\nI‚Äôm in awe of how the women in this Lean In Network show up for each other and our country. They are warriors in more ways than one. As we honor our great nation today, I thank them and everyone who has served.",

        "caption_text": "Two years ago, the Supreme Court struck down #RoeVWade. The Dobbs decision stripped women of the fundamental right to control their health and their futures. It made women in America less free today than half a century ago.\n\nSince then, nearly two dozen states have banned or limited access to safe and legal abortion services. In 10 states, abortion is banned with no exceptions for rape or incest. \n\nIn our Post-Roe America, what was once unconscionable is now commonplace. In Oklahoma, a woman was told to wait in the hospital parking lot until she was ‚Äúcrashing,‚Äù before doctors would provide care. In Ohio, a 10-year-old girl was forced to cross state lines to access care after she was raped. In Arizona, a woman was forced to carry an unviable pregnancy to term. In Texas, a woman miscarried in the lobby restroom of an emergency room as front desk staff refused to check her in. No woman should be forced to go through this trauma. \n\nThe fight for abortion rights doesn‚Äôt end with the Dobbs decision. Now, more than ever, we must redouble our efforts to defend and expand access to care. That means voting for reproductive choice in November.",

Since then Ellyn and @Accenture have been true partners in every step of the Thrive journey. First, we worked together to continue Ellyn‚Äôs mission to make Accenture the most truly human company in the digital age. Then there was Ellyn‚Äôs leadership in placing mental health at the center of the business agenda, which included Thrive‚Äôs unprecedented rollout of Thriving Mind at Accenture. \n\nAnd Ellyn continues to invest in health and well-being, and reshaping the organization to embrace the age of AI, all while the company doubled in size from 300,000 to 750,000.\nEllyn has become more than a partner, she has become a trusted friend. And what an amazing chapter of our lives we‚Äôre both in now, becoming grandmothers almost at the same time ‚Äì though as Ellyn is quick to remind me, she leapfrogged me with two when her daughter Jessie had twins. Congratulations on an incredible milestone and an extraordinary career, Ellyn. So looking forward to seeing all the ways you continue your mission!\n\nHere are some photos from our years together starting with Ellyn and me at our @Thrive launch party.",

It‚Äôs not just her incredible and now record-breaking performance ‚Äî becoming the most decorated female Olympic gymnast of all time ‚Äî but how she‚Äôs done it and the role model she‚Äôs become. After withdrawing from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, she prioritized her physical and mental health and then returned very much on her own terms. That‚Äôs a medal-worthy achievement of its own. As she says, ‚ÄúIf it's not your decision, you're not having fun‚Ä¶ If you're having fun, that's when the best memories are built.\"\n\nAnd congratulations to @sunisalee on her bronze medal in the individual all-around and the entire @usagym team for their amazing performance and well-deserved gold medal.",
